Brennan suggested that I should post this here. 
I need a Logo for an opensource pageturning  Bookscanner that I will be building. 
The name of the project is "Libreflip"
The Logo should contain a Book, or a symbolized book.
If possible something that symbolises the scanning, but not necessarily
I just need a simple vector-file for this, I will pick colors later in the process (open to suggestions)
The logo ńeeds to work as just a vector, as it will be cnc-milled on every machine.
The logo needs to have two parts: a symbol and the title "Libreflip"
On the machine the Symbol will be left of the written Title, on the website the symbol might be centered above the text
If arranged so that the symbol is left of the text in the same line, and scaled so that the whole logo is 8cm high, no single detail can be smaller then 4mm
Currently I am trying to secure funding through various sources. when successful, I will pay you 50-100€ for designing a great logo. If I do not secure any funding (unlikely) then this will be a gratis/free job.

Thanks a lot in advance!

Cheers
Ijon

edit: thanks everyone, I had some days off, spent them in the forest and a lightningbolt of creativity hit me, so I designed a logo for myself. Thanks to B. for giving me feedback on all of the 12 iterations before I decided that it was done.
